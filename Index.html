      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p1>
        Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (Bhīmrao Ramji Ambedkar; 14 April 1891 – 6
        December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and
        political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of
        India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice
        minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the
        Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism. After graduating from
        Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at
        Columbia University and the London School of Economics, receiving
        doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of
        Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s. He
        also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he
        was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by
        his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and
        negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political
        rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the
        establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism,
        initiating mass conversions of Dalits. In 1990, the Bharat Ratna,
        India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar.
        The salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours
        him. He is also referred to by the nickname Babasaheb (BAH-ba SAH-hayb),
        meaning "Respected Father".
